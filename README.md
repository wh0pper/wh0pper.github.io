ahh, can't forget about the readme! 

what a perfect place to document process. I'm building this out as a simple showcase of my work, my portfolio previously grew to feel too complex to easily maintain, so I'm getting back to basics and rolling my own static HTML page just to give a glimpse of the highlights. I hope this can be lightweight enough to drive conversion to conversation! I grew to feel very isolated working in tech through the pandemic, and miss the more collaborative nature of my prior experiences.

right now I have dumped all the pictures into this repo just to have them available, i plan to get more organized & strategic over time and probably implement a lightweight CMS so that content maintenance can be the simplest aspect here. Today I'm just getting this out the door with nice management of photos and basic mobile-friendly usage. It's very refreshing to build a simple html site after having gotten so deep into frameworks & libraries in my career.
