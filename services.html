  <h2>Hey, still Reija here... I heard you might be interested in contracting my services! ðŸ˜ƒ</h2>
  <h4>I have expertise as a musician, performer, visual artist, designer & software developer. I'm currently open to new opportunities leveraging any of these. For now I'm focused on:</h4>
  <div class="service-card">
    <div class="card-title">
      <p><strong>Beginner piano and voice lessons</strong> via zoom out of my bedroom in Los Angeles. My introductory rate is $50/hr, meeting as frequently as you would like for 30-90 minutes at a time. I'll be trying Calendly soon for direct scheduling, but for now you can call or text at (818) 856-1330.</p>

    <div class="sub-p">
      <p>I've received ~13 years of regular piano lessons myself, with a strong focus on Western classical theory, technique & performance. I participated in the NNMTA Youth Piano Festival throughout my teenage years, receiving some of their highest ratings. I've also utilized my training in accompaniment of solo and ensemble vocalists.</p>
      <p>I am especially fond of music from the Romantic & 20th Century periods. Some of my favorite composers being Mozart, Schubert, Debussy, Chopin, Tchaikovsky & Copland.</p>
      <p>Since 2012 my piano practice has been more independent with a focus on popular music & improvisation. I love to cover jazz standards & radio hits alike, especially artists such as Etta James, Ella Fitzgerald, Barbra Streisand, Billy Joel, Lady Gaga & Adele.</p>
      <p>In addition to piano, I'm deeply passionate about singing! I have participated in individual lessons & group rehearsals with numerous practitioners since my days in elementary school choir; primarily CeCe Gable of Reno and Daniel Stowe of the University of Notre Dame. Between 2011-2015 I was a member of both the Glee Club and Echoes Acapella at UND. I joined the Portland Gay Men's Chorus for the 2018-19 season. I now mostly sing independently with my focus on pop covers and exploring vocal gender expression. I'm actively looking for opportunities to join another chorus & perform solo in queer nightlife spaces.</p>
      <p>Since 2021 I have been exploring home studio recording of voice and piano. Currently I'm working with a Nord Piano 4 keyboard, Audio-Technica AT2035 cardioid microphone, Focusrite Scarlett 4i4 interface & Apple GarageBand.</p>
      <p>More recently I've performed live on Twitch and been publishing some of my own process on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWDcDFJn9md6Mg1WFvxoPLA">youtube</a>. More formal recordings & performances to come!</p>

  <div class="service-card">
    <div class="card-title">
      <p><strong>Web & mobile application development</strong> specializing in modern fullstack Javascript with the React & Node frameworks. I love to leverage my study of design & usability standards, CS fundamentals & monitoring tools in resilient engineering practices, functional team processes & architectural efficiency. Variable rate depending mostly on project technical complexity, $60-90/hr.
    </div>
        <div class="sub-p">
          <p>I have extensive experience designing and building interfaces alongside testing & deployment automation. I also possess over 5 years of practical knowledge with REST API development, data-modeling and database integration.</p>
          <p>Additional languages & frameworks I've worked with include Ruby on Rails, Python, Go, Angular, Express, Typescript & C#. I have worked on teams building & maintaining middleware services for integrating & automating with third-party APIs such as AWS, Quickbooks, FedEx, HubSpot & a variety of observability tooling. I've also completed several personal projects exploring IoT and creative tech applications, mostly with Arduino, Raspberry Pi & Addressable LEDs, connecting via wi-fi, bluetooth & RF control.</p>
          <p>Let me know your about your personal or business digital & web needs and I probably have some ideas for solutions & improvements. Software has gotten demanding and we all could use some further optimization. I'm more interested in building resilient processes than farming flashy features.</p>
