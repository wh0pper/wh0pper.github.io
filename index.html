  <h2>Hey I'm Ray! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
  <h4>Here's a glimpse at some projects I've worked on.</h4>
  <h5>The internet has gotten pretty wild in recent years, so I'm keeping this simple ðŸ˜‰</h5>
  <div>
    <h3>Frontend - my main focus. I'm an expert in web basics, well-versed in React, familiar with Angular & other popular UI libraries. I am obsessed with end-user experience and cannot rest until my interfaces are smoothly responsive and polished.</h3>
    <p>Simflora</p>
    <img src="./assets/simflora/simflora_gif.gif" alt="procedural tree growth animation" />
    <p>Inoculus</p>
    <img src="./assets/inoculus/ino_title.png" alt="empty game state displaying title" />
    <div class="image-row">
      <img src="./assets/inoculus/ino_small_gif.gif" alt="gif showing animation of an oscillatory sequence" />
      <img src="./assets/inoculus/ino_grn_still.png" alt="still image from game animation sequence" />
      <img src="./assets/inoculus/ino_pnk_still.png" alt="still image from game animation sequence showing color controls" />
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Backend - although I love keeping the user in mind, I have a track record of working adeptly across the stack</h3>
    <p>Glamajson</p>
    <img src="./assets/glamajson/glamajson_gif.gif" alt="gif showing functionality of API spec site"/>
    <p>I've also contributed to and maintained extensive backend systems in each of my positions, to less visually demonstrable effect. I've built out endpoints that are tightly-coupled to UI features in Node.js. Built and maintained automated processes for data-reporting and templated emails. I have fixed bugs and maintained performance & reliability of complex data services within a Ruby on Rails monolith. On top of building endpoints I have also contributed to and integrated with middleware services for data management between numerous third-party APIs, primarily in javascript.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Mobile - my smallest exposure thus far, would love more opportunities in this domain</h3>
    <p>Eraseer</p>
    <div class="image-row">
